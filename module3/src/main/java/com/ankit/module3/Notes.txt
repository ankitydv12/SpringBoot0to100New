Commit-->3.2--> Query Creation(Complete 3.2)
Note -> The Detail Notes is in notebook

Query can be Created by 2 ways:
    By deriving the query from the method name directly.
    By using a manually defined query.

Rules for Method Names
1. The name of our query method must start with one of the following
prefixes: find...By, read...By, query...By, and get...By.
Examples: findByName, readByName, queryByName, getByName
2. If we want to limit the number of returned query results, we can
add the First or the Top keyword before the first By word.
Examples: findFirstByName, readFirst2ByName, findTop10ByName
3. If we want to select unique results, we have to add the Distinct
keyword before the first By word.
Examples: findDistinctByName or findNameDistinctBy
4. Combine property expression with AND and OR.
Examples: findByNameOrDescription, findByNameAndDescription
