Commit-->3.4-->Sorting

This commit consist how to sort the data on different parameter:

   * we can sort the data by using dedicated query method like findByOrderByNameAsc() or findAllByOrderByNameDesc() like this
     but query method are overloaded with Sort parameter findByDepartment(String department, Sort sort):
   * Sorting is done by frontent like sort by the quantity , name of the product  and the implementation of the sorting in the backend
     To implement Sorting we have pass one more extra permeter to the query method that is Sort
    @Repository
    public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee,
    Long> {
    List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department, Sort sort);
    }

   * Working:
         The Controller method accept the requestParam that hold the varibale on which sorting is need to be done also provide the default value of the  requestParam
         sorting is done on the defaultValue in case of the requestParam is not provided
         Get the Object of the Sort Class by the Sort.by()
         Pass the requestParam to the Sort.by() -->  Sort.by(requestParam)

   * productRepo.findBy(Sort.by(Sort.Direction.DESC,sortBy,"price"));
      Sort.Direction.DESC  --> Sorting Order
      sortBy               --> Sorting Criteria
      "price"              --> if two product has same sortBy criteria then sorting done on the price
